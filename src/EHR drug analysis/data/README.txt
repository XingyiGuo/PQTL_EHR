Sample EHR inputs for the drugâ€“cancer analysis pipeline (documentation set)

Note: The production pipeline expects several files as Parquet.
These CSVs are intentionally small and are here to *illustrate schema and formatting*.
If you want to run the full script against these, convert them to Parquet first, e.g.:

    import pandas as pd
    df = pd.read_csv("pat_demo.csv", parse_dates=["birth_datetime"])
    df.to_parquet("pat_demo.parquet")
